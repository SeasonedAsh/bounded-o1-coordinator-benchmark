# Bounded O(1) Coordinator Benchmark  
100,000,000 Cycle Stability Test

This repository contains a raw benchmark artifact and supporting documentation
for a bounded-state (O(1)) coordination experiment.

The goal is to explore whether a minimal scheduler—designed so that state
transitions do not accumulate complexity—can maintain stable latency and memory
behavior under extreme load.
